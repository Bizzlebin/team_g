# Description
# 
# A small program to automatically create the basic NK Metadata Format header for all sorts of text files, from plaintext to code, and provide the full template for all code files; author is currently hard-coded and almost no error-checking is done as the point is to streamline most work while failing on [hopefully few] edge cases [which need user interventions and/or a code update].
