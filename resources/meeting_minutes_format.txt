In order to create clear meeting minutes, the inputs need to be complete yet concise—a seemingly-contradictory set of goals. Not everything should be written out, but all key data and points need to be derived from the meeting and/or the meeting record; this includes the attendance record. The minutes must be provided promptly according to the following template:

"""
Meeting Minutes [YYYY-MM-DD]

[...and other metadata according to NK Metadata Format]

Summary

**Absent**:[ Name(s)]
