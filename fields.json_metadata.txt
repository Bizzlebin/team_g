Description

This JSON contains both [NK] Metadata Format [generic sub]division field names at the top level and the setuptools field names (https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html) as children, allowing the readme to be parsed as a compliant UEWSG plaintext file and the setup.py field names to be extracted part by part with regex.

Schema

In NKCF-compliant Whitesmiths style.

"""
{
"[uewsg_division_name]":
	{
	"[setuptools_field_name]": "[direct-to-field string]" *or*
		{
		"field_regex": "[...]"
		}
	}
}
"""

===
Basic Format

Each section of the JSON is separated into individual sections called fields. These fields should translate into the fields of a NKMF compliant document (For example: title, authorship, etc.).

Each field contains keys for the keywords in the setuptools. Keywords can be found here: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html

Each keyword key has keys for the regex expression used to find the appropriate NKMF line. Optionally the keyword key may specify a match, group and flag.

The match indicates which match to use. Python's regex module's findall method will return a list of all pattern matches. The match value can be used to indicate which index to use.

GROUP KEY AND VALUE HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
The group value is used in regex expressions that utilize capture groups. To specified number inidicates the capture group's index that holds the appropriate sought value for a given key.

Todo

• Authorship author regex may return any value starting with """By""" other instances of """By""" should not appear in the authorship section but it's a known bug.

+++
Changelog

• 11/30/2020 Removed the flags and match fields. They were un-utilized and implemented with future expansion in mind. We're moving in a different direction and these keys were not part of it.
