This is the pseudo code for the readme_parser program's original read_fields function.

+++

This functions purpose is to use data (field names, RegEx patterns, filters, subfields) from FIELD_NAMES to search the readme file's text and pull the corresponding data values.

function read_fields(Text, FIELD_NAMES):
    Initialize a data structure to hold data values retrieved from readme text.
    Set search start value to start at beginning of text.

    Iterate through fields in FIELD_NAMES:
        Assign subfields to a variable.
        Try:
            Search the text for values matching the field's RegEx pattern.
            If field has filters:
                Assign to filters variable.
            Else:
                Assign empty string to filters variable. 
            Iterate through filters in filters:
                If filter is in the first part of the search result:
                    Add a blank field to data structure and exit current iteration.
                Else:
                    Update start index to ending index of search result.
                    if the search result value is None:
                        Add a blank field to the data structure
                    Else:
                        Add field with retrieved value to data structure
                    If there are subfields:
                        iterate through the subfields:
                            if the subfield data value is None:
                                Add a blank subfield to the data structure.
                            Else:
                                Add subfield with retrieved value to data structure.
        Except when an AttributeError occours from fields that cannot be RegExed:
            Add a blank field to data structure.
            If there are subfields:
                Iterate through subfields:
                    add blank subfield to data structure.
    return data structure.
